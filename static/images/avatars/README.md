# Player Avatars

This directory should contain player avatar images named in kebab-case format matching the quoted player names.

For example:
- johan-cruyff.jpg
- thierry-henry.jpg
- lionel-messi.jpg
- etc.

Images should be square format and ideally 200x200px or larger for optimal display.

For the initial implementation, you can use stock photos or player portraits properly credited according to usage rights.
