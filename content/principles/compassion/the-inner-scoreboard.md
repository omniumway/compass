quote: "I'm not a genius, I need other people to get the perfect information. When we win, we win together. When we lose, I lose."
quoteAuthor: "Jurgen Klopp"
quoteContext: "When Klopp takes personal responsibility for losses while distributing credit for wins, he's demonstrating his understanding of The Inner Scoreboard. His leadership is built on valuing effort, growth, and collective achievement over external validation or personal glory. This compassionate approach to measuring success has allowed him to build resilient teams that bounce back from setbacks and maintain perspective beyond just the scoreboard."
principle: "**The Inner Scoreboard**: External measures of success—goals, wins, selections—are only part of your football journey. Develop an inner scoreboard that tracks growth, effort, courage, and enjoyment—elements you can control regardless of external outcomes."
practice: "Create a personal \"Inner Scoreboard\" with three to five qualities you value that aren't measured on the official scoreboard. Examples might include \"full effort,\" \"positive communication,\" or \"brave decision-making.\" After your next match, take two minutes to rate yourself only on these internal measures, regardless of the game's result."
reflection: "What do you currently measure as \"success\" in your football? How might developing a more compassionate inner scoreboard change your experience of the game?"
