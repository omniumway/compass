quote: "I only do things within my power. If I can't control something, I just move on."
quoteAuthor: "Carli Lloyd"
quoteContext: "When Lloyd describes focusing only on what's within her control, she's demonstrating the wisdom of Knowing Enough. Her remarkable career, including scoring three goals in a World Cup final, was built on this compassionate discernment - understanding what she could influence and accepting what she couldn't. This approach allowed her to direct her energy efficiently and maintain peace of mind even in high-pressure situations."
principle: "**Knowing Enough**: You can't control everything in footballâ€”the referee, the weather, your opponent's tactics. True composure comes from having the wisdom to know which elements you can control, the courage to address those elements, and the serenity to accept the rest."
practice: "Create two columns on a piece of paper labeled \"Within My Control\" and \"Outside My Control.\" List at least five elements of your football in each column. Before your next match or training, review this list and set an intention to focus your energy only on the elements within your control, while practicing acceptance of the rest."
reflection: "What aspects of football do you currently waste energy trying to control that are actually outside your influence? How might redirecting that energy toward controllable elements change your experience?"
