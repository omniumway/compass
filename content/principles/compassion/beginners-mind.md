quote: "I've always said I want to write my story in football... but even I didn't think things would go this quickly."
quoteAuthor: "Kylian Mbappé"
quoteContext: "When Mbappé expresses surprise at his rapid rise, he reveals the Beginner's Mind that has been crucial to his development. Despite his immense talent, he approaches football with the humility and openness of a beginner, allowing him to absorb new learning without the obstacle of thinking he already knows everything. His perspective combines confidence in writing his own story with the openness to be surprised by how it unfolds."
principle: "**Beginner's Mind**: Approach each training and match with the fresh eyes of a beginner—curious, open, and eager to learn. Release the need to appear expert or perfect, and instead embrace the continuous growth that comes from a learner's mindset."
practice: "In your next training session, choose one fundamental skill you consider yourself already proficient in. Approach it with \"beginner's mind\" by asking yourself: \"If I were learning this for the first time, what would I notice?\" Look for new details, sensations, or possibilities as if experiencing this skill for the first time."
reflection: "In what areas of your football do you feel most fixed in your ways or resistant to new approaches? How might bringing a beginner's mind to these areas create new possibilities?"

<!-- Note: This principle had two quotes. We're using the primary one in the front matter.
Second quote was:
"Mistakes are proof that you are trying and learning." — Marcus Rashford

*Rashford's perspective on mistakes embodies the compassionate aspect of Beginner's Mind. By viewing errors as valuable evidence of effort and growth rather than failures, he creates the psychological safety needed to continue taking risks and developing. This mindful approach to learning allows him to maintain both performance and continuous improvement.*
