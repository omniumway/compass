quote: "Leadership can be lonely and there can be inherent biases in your own coaching team so it was great to have an outsider who could reflect on my behaviors, then get me to reframe things."
quoteAuthor: "Emma Hayes"
quoteContext: "When Hayes speaks about leadership's loneliness and the value of outside perspective, she's revealing how Leadership Ripples work. Her success as a coach comes from understanding that every leadership action creates waves of influence. By seeking feedback on her own behavior, she models the self-reflection necessary for growth, creating positive ripples that extend throughout her team."
principle: "**Leadership Ripples**: Every action you take as a leader—whether captain, senior player, or simply someone others look to—creates ripples that affect the entire team. By being mindful of these ripples, you can create waves of positive influence that extend far beyond your immediate actions."
practice: "Before your next match, identify one specific leadership behavior you want to embody—perhaps encouragement after mistakes, or calm communication during pressure. Focus completely on that one behavior throughout the match, regardless of the score or situation. Afterward, notice how your consistent example affected teammates' behavior."
reflection: "Think of a time when someone else's leadership positively affected your performance. What specific behaviors created that impact? How might you create similar ripples for others?"
