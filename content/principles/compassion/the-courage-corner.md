quote: "Be more. Be better. Be bigger than you've ever been before."
quoteAuthor: "Megan Rapinoe"
quoteContext: "When Rapinoe challenges us to be bigger than we've ever been, she's inviting us to find The Courage Corner within ourselves. Her career has been defined by courage - both on the field with decisive penalty kicks in crucial moments, and off the field standing up for equality. Her message reminds us that true compassion includes having the courage to believe in your own potential and to take bold action."
principle: "**The Courage Corner**: Fear and doubt are normal parts of every footballer's journey. Instead of fighting these feelings, create a courage corner in your mind—a safe space where you can acknowledge fears while still moving forward with self-compassion and bravery."
practice: "Before your next challenging football situation, take a moment to visualize your \"courage corner\"—a mental space where you can honestly acknowledge any fears or doubts. Imagine speaking to these fears with compassion, saying: \"It's okay to feel nervous. I'm still showing up.\" Notice how this compassionate acknowledgment often reduces the fear's power over you."
reflection: "What specific fears or doubts most often hold you back in football? How might acknowledging them with self-compassion, rather than trying to ignore them, change your relationship with these fears?"

Second quote was:
"You have to be fearless and take risks to achieve greatness." — Megan Rapinoe

*Rapinoe's emphasis on fearlessness speaks directly to The Courage Corner. Her willingness to take risks - both in her playing style and her advocacy - demonstrates how courage and compassion are intertwined. She shows that supporting yourself through moments of fear, rather than being limited by it, is essential to reaching your highest potential.*
