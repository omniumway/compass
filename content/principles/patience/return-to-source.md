quote: "Sometimes words are harder than blows."
quoteAuthor: "Zinedine Zidane"
quoteContext: "When Zidane reflects on how words can hurt more than physical blows, he touches on the emotional dimension of football that connects to Return to Source. His career showed both the brilliance of playing from joy and connection, as well as the consequences of disconnection, as in his World Cup final sending off. His journey reminds us of the importance of returning to our original motivation and love for the game, especially in difficult moments."
principle: "**Return to Source**: When the game becomes complicated, stressful, or joyless, return to your original source of inspiration. Reconnect with the pure joy and love that first drew you to football."
practice: "Take 10 minutes to play with a ball in a way that reconnects you with the joy of the game. No drills, no pressureâ€”just play. It might be juggling, trying tricks, or simply passing against a wall. Focus on the sensations and enjoyment that first made you fall in love with football."
reflection: "What aspects of football still connect you to that original joy? How might you incorporate more of these elements into your regular training and matches?"
