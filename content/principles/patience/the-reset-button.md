quote: "Your love makes me strong, your hate makes me unstoppable."
quoteAuthor: "Cristiano Ronaldo"
quoteContext: "When Ronaldo speaks about transforming both love and hate into motivation, he demonstrates his mastery of The Reset Button. Throughout his career, he's shown an remarkable ability to reset after setbacks - missed penalties, losses, or criticism - channeling emotional responses into renewed determination. His mental resilience comes from this ability to continually refresh his mindset regardless of what came before."
principle: "**The Reset Button**: Every moment offers a fresh start. No matter what happened in the previous play, the previous half, or the previous match, you can always press the reset button and begin again with a clear mind."
practice: "Choose a physical gesture to serve as your \"reset button\"â€”perhaps taking a deep breath while adjusting your socks, or quickly touching the ground. In your next match, use this gesture deliberately after mistakes or when feeling frustrated to clear your mind and refocus on the present moment."
reflection: "How do you currently respond to mistakes or setbacks during a match? How might having a consistent \"reset button\" change your ability to recover quickly?"
