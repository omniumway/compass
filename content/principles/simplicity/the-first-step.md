quote: "Playing football is very simple, but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is."
quoteAuthor: "Johan Cruyff"
quoteContext: "When Cruyff speaks about simplicity in football, he's describing what we call The First Step - the understanding that beneath all the complexity of the game lies a simple core. Finding that simplicity gives you a reference point to return to when the game feels overwhelming."
principle: "**The First Step**: The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Don't get overwhelmed by the entire match. Break the game down into a series of first steps, each one manageable and clear."
practice: "In your next game, when feeling stuck or uncertain, ask yourself: \"What's just the first step I need to take right now?\" Focus only on that immediate action, not the entire sequence that might follow."
reflection: "What situations in football make you freeze up by thinking too many steps ahead? How might focusing on just the first step help?"
