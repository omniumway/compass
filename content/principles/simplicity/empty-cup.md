quote: "I am still learning, and I hope I will continue to learn all my life."
quoteAuthor: "Pep Guardiola"
quoteContext: "When Guardiola speaks about continual learning, he embodies the Empty Cup principle. Despite being one of football's most successful managers, his humility and willingness to approach each situation with fresh eyes has been the cornerstone of his sustained success. He empties his cup of preconceptions to make room for new insights."
principle: "**Empty Cup**: To receive new learning, first empty your cup of what you think you know. When you approach football with a beginner's mind—curious and open—insights and improvements flow naturally."
practice: "In your next training session, choose one basic skill you believe you've already mastered. Approach it as if learning it for the first time—with curiosity and no assumptions. Notice what new details emerge when you empty your cup of previous knowledge."
reflection: "What aspects of your game do you hold most rigidly to \"the right way\" of doing things? How might emptying your cup create space for growth?"
