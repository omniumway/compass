quote: "In football you always have to be thinking, thinking, thinking. You have to be switched on."
quoteAuthor: "Thierry Henry"
quoteContext: "When Henry talks about being \"switched on,\" he's describing the intense focus required to stay present in the game. His success came from this ability to remain completely focused on the immediate moment - not dwelling on past mistakes or worrying about future outcomes."
principle: "**Present Foot**: Your body plays football in the present moment, but your mind often travels to the past or future. When you align your attention with where your feet are right now, your natural abilities flow without interference."
practice: "In your next training session, whenever you notice your mind worrying about outcomes or replaying mistakes, silently say \"present foot\" and bring your full attention to the physical sensation of your feetâ€”touching the ground, contacting the ball, or moving through space."
reflection: "When during matches does your mind most often leave the present moment? How might \"present foot\" help in those situations?"
