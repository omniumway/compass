quote: "It's all about creating space. Space, space, space. It's like being on the PlayStation. I think 'I'll wait... wait... wait... then BOOM! I've got space.'"
quoteAuthor: "Xavi Hernandez"
quoteContext: "When Xavi describes his approach to finding space, he's revealing his mastery of The Invisible Game. He sees patterns that others don't - the spaces between players, the timing of movements, the rhythm of play. His success came from seeing and understanding this invisible dimension of football that exists beyond the physical."
principle: "**The Invisible Game**: Beyond the visible game of players, ball, and goals exists an invisible game of space, time, and energy. Learn to see and play this hidden dimension where the real game unfolds."
practice: "Watch 10 minutes of a professional match with the sound off. Don't focus on the ballâ€”instead, observe the spaces opening and closing, the timing of runs, and the energy shifts between teams. Notice how the best players seem aware of this invisible game."
reflection: "What aspects of the invisible game do you notice most during play? How might you become more sensitive to them?"
