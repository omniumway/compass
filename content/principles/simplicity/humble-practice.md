quoteAuthor: "Son Heung-min"
quoteContext: "When Son describes his humility extending beyond words into constant improvement, he's illustrating the essence of Humble Practice. Despite being one of the Premier League's most talented players, his approach centers on identifying what's missing rather than celebrating what's mastered. His success comes from transforming the self-awareness of limitations into focused work rather than discouragement, showing how true humility simplifies improvement by removing ego from the equation."
principle: "**Humble Practice**: Progress accelerates when you focus on what's missing rather than what's mastered. By approaching training with genuine humility—seeing gaps as opportunities rather than criticisms—you remove the complication of ego and simplify the path to improvement."
practice: "After your next strong performance, resist the urge to bask in success. Instead, identify one specific aspect of your game that still needs improvement. Design a simple, focused 15-minute practice routine targeting this element, and commit to it for the next week. Notice how this humble focus affects both your improvement and your relationship with success."
reflection: "In what areas of your game do you tend to become satisfied or complacent? How might adopting humble practice in these areas unlock new levels of improvement?"
